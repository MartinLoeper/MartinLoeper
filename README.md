## About

Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Martin, a cloud solutions architect working for the start-up company <a href="https://nesto-software.de/">Nesto</a> from Karlsruhe, Germany.
Over the last couple of years, I realized that life in a growing start-up inevitably had pushed me towards the Dev-Ops boundary. Hence, I consider myself *somewhere between Dev and Ops*: Sometimes architecting cloud workloads, sometimes monitoring traffic and scaling activity, sometimes developing a fleet of IoT devices, and most importantly, embracing *lifelong learning*.
